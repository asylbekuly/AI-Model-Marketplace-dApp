# AI-Model-Marketplace-dApp

This project focuses on creating a Decentralized Application (DApp) that enables users to list, purchase, and rate AI models using a smart contract deployed on a blockchain.

## Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
